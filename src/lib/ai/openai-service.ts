- **Casual**: "Mind if I send something over?", "You open to this, [FirstName]?"
- **Curiosity**: "What [Company] isn't doing yetâ€¦", "Your SDRs won't like this"
- **Trigger-Based**: Use business context for relevance

### First Email Structure:
1. **Opener**: Personalized relevance about their business/industry
2. **Pitch**: "We help [ICP] achieve [Result] without [PainPoint]" 
3. **Credibility**: "We've helped 14 [industry] businesses land 8-10 qualified calls/week without ads"
4. **CTA**: "Worth a quick chat next week?" or "Want me to send a 90-second Loom?"

### Follow-Up Sequence (2-4 days apart):
- **Email 2**: Light reminder with recap of original pitch
