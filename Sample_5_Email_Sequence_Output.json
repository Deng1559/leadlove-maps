      "body": "Hi Maria,\n\nHope you're managing well with the crazy Miami Beach tourist season hitting full swing this month!\n\nI noticed Tony's Pizzeria has built quite a reputation in the Wynwood area (4.3 stars with 127 reviews) - clearly doing something right in such a competitive market, especially being so close to all those trendy spots on NW 2nd Avenue.\n\nI've been working with similar family restaurants in South Florida and noticed many are struggling to capture the tourist traffic that's literally walking past their doors every day. Most visitors are searching for \"pizza near me\" but many great local spots aren't showing up in those critical mobile searches.\n\nWe recently helped 3 Miami restaurants increase their visibility to tourists and locals, seeing 40% more walk-ins during peak season.\n\nWould you be open to a quick 10-minute call to share what we learned about capturing that foot traffic in your neighborhood?\n\nBest regards,\nAlex",

I could walk you through it in about 15 minutes.\n\nBest,\nAlex",

      "body": "Hi {{FirstName}},\n\nHope you caught that great article about {{Neighborhood}}'s restaurant scene in the Miami Herald last week!\n\nI thought you'd find this interesting - we recently worked with Casa Luigi, a family Italian restaurant in Little Havana that was facing a similar challenge to {{BusinessName}}: amazing food and loyal locals, but tourists were walking right past to the flashier places.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\n**Before**: 60% locals, 40% tourists, $8,500 average monthly online orders\n**After 3 months**: 45% locals, 55% tourists, $14,200 monthly online orders\n\nThe breakthrough was optimizing for \"authentic Italian Miami\" searches and showcasing their family recipes and history. Tourists don't just want good food - they want the authentic Miami experience that only places like Casa Luigi and {{BusinessName}} can provide.\n\nTheir owner, Giuseppe, told me last week: \"We're not just serving more customers - we're serving the RIGHT customers who appreciate what makes us special.\"\n\nThe strategies that worked for Casa Luigi would work perfectly for {{BusinessName}}'s location and tourist traffic patterns.\n\nWant to see the specific tactics we used? I could show you in a quick 15-minute screen share.\n\nBest,\nAlex",

      "body": "Hi {{FirstName}},\n\nHope you're staying cool during this Miami heat wave!\n\nI imagine by now you might be thinking, \"We tried online marketing before and it didn't really work for us.\" I hear this from Miami restaurant owners all the time, and honestly, they're usually right to be skeptical.\n\nMost marketing agencies treat local restaurants like they're national chains. They use generic strategies that work for big brands but completely miss what makes neighborhood places like {{BusinessName}} special - that authentic, family atmosphere that locals love and tourists are searching for.\n\nHere's the difference: we focus exclusively on local businesses in South Florida. We understand that your competition isn't just other pizzerias - it's every restaurant competing for the same foot traffic walking down {{LocalStreet}}.\n\nPlus, we start with small, measurable improvements rather than big expensive campaigns. Think optimizing your Google listing for \"pizza {{Neighborhood}}\" searches before spending money on ads.\n\nThe Casa Luigi owner I mentioned was skeptical too - he'd been burned by two previous agencies. But we started small, proved results, then scaled what worked.\n\nWould you be open to a brief call where I could show you exactly what we'd do differently for {{BusinessName}}? No commitment, just insights you can use either way.\n\nBest,\nAlex",

      "body": "Hi {{FirstName}},\n\nHope the weekend was good to you with all the beautiful weather bringing people out!\n\nI know you're busy running {{BusinessName}}, so I'll keep this brief.\n\nI've been thinking about our conversation thread, and I keep coming back to this: {{BusinessName}} has everything needed to dominate the {{Neighborhood}} pizza scene - amazing food, great location, loyal customers.\n\nThe only thing missing is making sure tourists and new locals can find you as easily as the regulars do.\n\nI'd hate for you to miss out on what could be your biggest season yet, especially with Miami's tourism numbers hitting record highs this year.\n\nHere's what I can do: I'll spend 15 minutes this week showing you exactly what {{BusinessName}}'s online presence looks like to potential customers right now, and give you 2-3 specific improvements you can make immediately (whether you work with us or not).\n\nJust reply with \"YES\" and I'll send you a quick link to grab 15 minutes when it's convenient for you.\n\nEither way, best of luck with the busy season!\n\nAlex\n\nP.S. - If you're not interested, no worries at all. Just reply \"NO THANKS\" and I'll make sure you don't hear from me again.",
