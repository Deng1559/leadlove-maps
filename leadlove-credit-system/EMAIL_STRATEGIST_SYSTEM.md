    "Quick question, {{FirstName}}",
    "Helping {{Company}} hit {{Metric}}",
    "{{FirstName}}, quick {{industry}} question"
  ]
  casual: [
    "Mind if I send something over?",
    "You open to this, {{FirstName}}?",
    "Worth a quick look?"
  ]
  curiosity: [
    "What {{Company}} isn't doing yet‚Ä¶",
    "A new angle for {{Company}}‚Ä¶",
    "{{FirstName}}, missed opportunity?"
  ]
  triggerBased: [
    "Congrats on the new hire, {{FirstName}}",
    "Saw your LinkedIn post about {{Topic}}",
    "Following up on {{Company}}'s expansion"
  ]
}
```

### First Email Template

```
Subject: [Choose from subject line options]

{opener} // One line explaining why you're reaching out

{pitch} // "We help {ICP} achieve {Result} without {PainPoint}."

{credibility} // Quick proof point or guarantee

{callToAction} // "Worth a quick chat next week?" / "Want me to send a 90-second Loom?"

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Follow-Up Sequence (2-4 days apart)

**Email 2 - Reminder**
```
Subject: In case you missed it, {{FirstName}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

In case my last note slipped by your inbox‚Ä¶

Quick recap: We're helping {ICP} like {{Company}} achieve {Result} without the usual {PainPoint} headaches.

{credibility}

Still worth a brief chat to see if there's a fit?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 3 - New Proof**
```
Subject: {{SimilarClient}} case study

{{FirstName}},

Just wrapped up with {{SimilarClient}} ‚Äì helped them drive {{ClientWin}} in 30 days.

The approach we used could work well for {{Company}} too, especially given your focus on {{Topic}}.

Worth a 15-minute call to walk through the specifics?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Happy to send over the case study if you're interested.
```

**Email 4 - New Angle**
```
Subject: Different angle for {{Company}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

I realize {Result} might not be your top priority right now.

But what if I told you there's a way to {AlternateValue} with just 2 hours of work per week?

Most {{Industry}} businesses we work with see results in the first 30 days.

Worth exploring? I can send over a quick 3-minute video showing exactly how it works.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 5 - Goodbye**
```
Subject: Final note, {{FirstName}}

{{FirstName}},

No worries if timing isn't right ‚Äì I know you're busy running {{Company}}.

I've put together a quick 3-point Loom video showing how {{SimilarClient}} increased their {{Metric}} by 40% in 60 days.

Even if we never work together, the insights might be valuable for your {{Industry}} strategy.

Want me to send it over?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. This is my last email ‚Äì I won't follow up again unless you'd like me to.
```
