## 📧 Example 5-Email Sequence

### **Example: Digital Marketing for Miami Restaurant**

#### **Email 1 (Day 1): Warm Introduction & Local Connection**
**Subject:** Quick thought about the Miami restaurant scene
**Preview:** Hope you're managing well with this busy season...

> Hi Maria,
> 
> Hope you're managing well with the crazy Miami Beach tourist season hitting full swing this month!
> 
> I noticed Tony's Pizzeria has built quite a reputation in the Wynwood area (4.3 stars with 127 reviews) - clearly doing something right in such a competitive market, especially being so close to all those trendy spots on NW 2nd Avenue.
> 
> I've been working with similar family restaurants in South Florida and noticed many are struggling to capture the tourist traffic that's literally walking past their doors every day. Most visitors are searching for "pizza near me" but many great local spots aren't showing up in those critical mobile searches.
> 
> We recently helped 3 Miami restaurants increase their visibility to tourists and locals, seeing 40% more walk-ins during peak season.
> 
> Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call to share what we learned about capturing that foot traffic in your neighborhood?
> 
> Best regards,
> Alex

#### **Email 2 (Day 4): Value Proposition & Benefits**
**Subject:** How Miami restaurants capture more tourist traffic
**Preview:** Three specific strategies working in Wynwood...

> Hi Maria,
> 
> Hope business has been picking up with the beautiful weather we've been having!
> 
> I wanted to share what we've learned about helping Miami restaurants like Tony's capture more of the tourist and local foot traffic, especially in high-energy areas like Wynwood.
> 
> Here's what's working for local restaurants right now:
> 
> **Local Search Dominance**: When tourists search "best pizza Wynwood," you want to be the first result, not the chain restaurants.
> 
> **Real-Time Social Proof**: Live updates about fresh specials, crowd energy, and authentic atmosphere that tourists are looking for.
> 
> **Mobile-First Experience**: 78% of restaurant searches happen on mobile while people are walking around looking for their next meal.
> 
> The restaurants we work with in your area typically see 35-50% more discovery traffic within the first 2 months, plus higher-value orders from tourists who spend more than locals.
> 
> Would you like to see exactly how this works for a pizzeria in your location? I could walk you through it in about 15 minutes.
> 
> Best,
> Alex

#### **Email 3 (Day 8): Local Case Study**
**Subject:** How Casa Luigi went from hidden gem to neighborhood hotspot
**Preview:** A Little Havana success story...

> Hi Maria,
> 
> Hope you caught that great article about Wynwood's restaurant scene in the Miami Herald last week!
> 
> I thought you'd find this interesting - we recently worked with Casa Luigi, a family Italian restaurant in Little Havana that was facing a similar challenge to Tony's: amazing food and loyal locals, but tourists were walking right past to the flashier places.
> 
> Here's what happened:
> 
> **Before**: 60% locals, 40% tourists, $8,500 average monthly online orders
> **After 3 months**: 45% locals, 55% tourists, $14,200 monthly online orders
> 
> The breakthrough was optimizing for "authentic Italian Miami" searches and showcasing their family recipes and history. Tourists don't just want good food - they want the authentic Miami experience that only places like Casa Luigi and Tony's can provide.
> 
> Their owner, Giuseppe, told me last week: "We're not just serving more customers - we're serving the RIGHT customers who appreciate what makes us special."
> 
> The strategies that worked for Casa Luigi would work perfectly for Tony's location and tourist traffic patterns.
> 
> Want to see the specific tactics we used? I could show you in a quick 15-minute screen share.
> 
> Best,
> Alex

#### **Email 4 (Day 12): Overcoming Objections**
**Subject:** "We tried online marketing before..."
**Preview:** I hear this from Miami restaurant owners all the time...

> Hi Maria,
> 
> Hope you're staying cool during this Miami heat wave!
> 
> I imagine by now you might be thinking, "We tried online marketing before and it didn't really work for us." I hear this from Miami restaurant owners all the time, and honestly, they're usually right to be skeptical.
> 
> Most marketing agencies treat local restaurants like they're national chains. They use generic strategies that work for big brands but completely miss what makes neighborhood places like Tony's special - that authentic, family atmosphere that locals love and tourists are searching for.
> 
> Here's the difference: we focus exclusively on local businesses in South Florida. We understand that your competition isn't just other pizzerias - it's every restaurant competing for the same foot traffic walking down NW 2nd Avenue.
> 
> Plus, we start with small, measurable improvements rather than big expensive campaigns. Think optimizing your Google listing for "pizza Wynwood" searches before spending money on ads.
> 
> The Casa Luigi owner I mentioned was skeptical too - he'd been burned by two previous agencies. But we started small, proved results, then scaled what worked.
> 
> Would you be open to a brief call where I could show you exactly what we'd do differently for Tony's? No commitment, just insights you can use either way.
> 
> Best,
> Alex

#### **Email 5 (Day 16): Final Nudge & Easy Next Step**
**Subject:** Last thought about Tony's potential
**Preview:** Quick favor - 2 minutes of your time?

> Hi Maria,
> 
> Hope the weekend was good to you with all the beautiful weather bringing people out!
> 
> I know you're busy running Tony's, so I'll keep this brief.
> 
> I've been thinking about our conversation thread, and I keep coming back to this: Tony's has everything needed to dominate the Wynwood pizza scene - amazing food, great location, loyal customers. 
> 
> The only thing missing is making sure tourists and new locals can find you as easily as the regulars do.
> 
> I'd hate for you to miss out on what could be your biggest season yet, especially with Miami's tourism numbers hitting record highs this year.
> 
> Here's what I can do: I'll spend 15 minutes this week showing you exactly what Tony's online presence looks like to potential customers right now, and give you 2-3 specific improvements you can make immediately (whether you work with us or not).
> 
> Just reply with "YES" and I'll send you a quick link to grab 15 minutes when it's convenient for you.
> 
> Either way, best of luck with the busy season!
> 
> Alex
> 
> P.S. - If you're not interested, no worries at all. Just reply "NO THANKS" and I'll make sure you don't hear from me again.
